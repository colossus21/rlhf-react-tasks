Output a self-contained .jsx React+Tailwind+Shadcn app that accomplishes the following task:
<task>
Can you create this widget called "VIP Countdown", I want to see my next upcoming event with a timer:
1. Provide a code plan first. The widget would show a large countdown at the center of the page. This countdown would have a event name above it and next and previous event below it with space-around. Show both buttons but make it active-inactive based on the event availability.
2. Widget shows only one countdown for the next event, if finished, shows timer to next closest event. If there are no events to show, shows no timer and "No events!"
3. Here is how events should look like:
{ emoji: 'üéÇ', name: "Joe's Birthday", date: "2024-13-01" }
4. Below the widget there should be an info section showing list of events today and how many events are there in the current month.
5. User should be able to add event by setting title, select emoji from dropdown (provide at least 10 emojis for birthdays, anniversay etc), date. The add event box should be shown on a modal.
6. Use a purple and indigo color scheme
</task>

Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using ‚Äú@/components‚Äù like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
