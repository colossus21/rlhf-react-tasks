Output a self-contained .jsx React+Tailwind+Shadcn app that accomplishes the following task:
<task>
Can you create a game called 'Space Lights Out' with the following features, provide code plan before code:
1. A 6x6 grid of lights representing stars in neonish green color.
2. Clicking a panel toggles its state and the state of up, down, left and right panels. The goal is to turn off all lights.
3. Add a move counter to track turns below the game.
4. Use a space themed background (deep blue) with scrolling stars. Center the layout.
5. An algorithm to simulate 10 presses randomly with all lights turned off should be created to create the initial board such that the board is solvable.
6. Show winning message after the game is over below the game. Use no external images or sounds, use CSS for stars and scrolling backgrounds.
</task>

Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using “@/components” like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
