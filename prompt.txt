Output a self-contained .jsx React+Tailwind+Shadcn app that accomplishes the following task:
<task>
Can you create game by using tailwind and shadcn with the following features:
i) Provide a code plan first. The game should show 4 elements at start: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Each element should have unicode symbols/emojis.
ii) there should be 3 boxes represented like box below the elements: box 1 + box 2 = box 3. boxes should be square shaped and can hold emojis.
iii) Player can drag elements to box 1 and box 2. Box 3 would show the combined elements. There would be a reset button below. Use emoji of the element.
iv) Here's a list of combinations:
Fire + Water = Steam
Fire + Earth = Lava
Air + Earth = Dust
Water + Earth = Mud
Fire + Air = Energy
Water + Energy = Life
v) Show a progress report of how many elements have been discovered below the combiner with a section "Discovered Combinations:" then show the discovered elements in tags. Below tags show progress i.e. 1/6. congrats the player upon finding all combinations.
vi) Make it visually appealing by centering the container, applying borders to boxes etc.
vii) Styles should be nature themed. Do not use external images. Emojis should be distinct.

Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using “@/components” like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
