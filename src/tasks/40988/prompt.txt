Output a self-contained .jsx React+Tailwind+Shadcn app that accomplishes the following task:
<task>
Can you create a chess-like strategy game called 'Samurai Tactics' with the following:
1. Provide code plan first. Create a 6x5 (6 rows, 5 columns) grid board with the 4 types of pieces:
a) Ronin: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of spaces,
b) Samurai: Moves diagonally any number of spaces,
c) Daimyo: Moves one space in any direction.
d) Ninja: Moves exactly 2 spaces in any direction (including diagonally) but, cannot capture Daimyo
Use these symbols - ü§∫ Samurai, ‚öîÔ∏è Ronin, ü•∑ Ninja, üëπ Daimyo, make red and blue pieces distinguishable by adding a circular background.
2. First row for each player is Samurai, Ronin, Daimyo, Ronin, Samurai. Second row is five Ninjas. Two players: Red (top) and Blue (bottom) play this game in turns.
3. Just like chess pieces capture by moving to an opponent's square. A player wins by capturing other player's Daimyo.
4. UI: highlight valid moves in yellow when a piece is selected. Display current player and winner announcement for team name Red or Blue use respective color. Add a restart button after the game. The cells are black in background, internal container is white. Has a title over the game.
5. Provide a single .jsx file, no external image file should be used. Use a black and grey gradient background outside the game container.

Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using ‚Äú@/components‚Äù like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
