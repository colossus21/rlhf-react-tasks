Output a self-contained .jsx React+Tailwind+Shadcn app that accomplishes the following task:
<task>
I play age of empire with my friends in 2 teams, but not everyone is equally skilled. Can you create a widget named team shuffler with the following features:
i) Provide a code plan first. Show an input box that takes list of player names - player names are taken in comma-separated manner, use appropriate title and label. Place a button named generate team below the form. Place 6 random names by default. User can't press the generate team button if the number of names are not even.
ii) Next, all team members are shown without any team assigned - user can add rules based on the following a) Player A and B can't be on the same team b) Player A and B should be on the same team. Add a Shuffle Team button.
iii) Shuffle team divides the names provided in 2 different boxes - team red and team blue.
iv) Players are generated by clicking the generate team button only. Then show the player list. Teams are only shown after shuffle team is pressed.
v) Make the font color of red team red with light red bg. Blue team blue colored font. No external images and libraries and single jsx file please.

Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using “@/components” like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
